# Building Your Own API from this Repository Code

In this chapter, we will guide you on how to create your own API from the code in the repository. The API in this repository has been designed to be easily adaptable to any project by making a few simple changes to the code, which we will cover in the following sections.

We will start by introducing the repository code and its structure, followed by a discussion on how to make modifications to the code to fit your specific use case. Then, we will go through the steps of testing and deploying the API to ensure it is ready for use in your project.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a complete understanding of how to create your own API using the code from the repository and the modifications you made to fit your specific requirements. With this knowledge, you will be able to easily build and deploy custom APIs for your projects in the future.

## Understanding the Repository Code Structure

The repository code is structured in a way that makes it easy to understand and modify. The main components of the code are organized into different folders, each with a specific purpose. Let's take a look at the structure of the repository code:

1. **app**: This folder contains the main code of the API and is structured as follows:
    - **models**: This folder contains the data models used by the API. These models define the structure of the data that will be stored and retrieved by the API.
    - **routers**: This folder contains the code that handles the routing of incoming requests to the correct endpoint in the API.
    - **services**: This folder contains the code that implements the core functionality of the API.
    - **static**: This folder contains any static files, such as images or CSS, that are required by the API.
    - **templates**: This folder contains the HTML templates used by the API.
    - **tests**: This folder contains the test cases for the API.

2. **docs**: This folder contains the documentation for the API.

3. **Dockerfile**: This file contains the instructions for building a Docker image for the API.

4. **docker-compose.yaml**: This file is used to configure and run the API using Docker.

5. **README.md**: This file contains the documentation for the repository.

6. **requirements.txt**: This file lists the dependencies required to run the API.

7. **.env**: This file contains the environment variables required to run the API.

By understanding the structure of the repository code, you will be able to navigate and modify the code with ease.

## Modifying the Repository Code

Assuming you have forked the repository, the first step to create your own API is to modify the code in the repository to match your requirements. This chapter will guide you through the changes that you need to make to the repository code.

1. Modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file. Replace the word "generic-api" to the desired name for your API. This name will be used to identify the API in your Docker environment.
2. Update the environment variables: The [.env file](./env_file/env-file-description.md) contains the environment variables required to run the API. You should update the values in the .env file to match your environment. 
3. Modify the data models: The data models in the models folder define the structure of the data that will be stored and retrieved by the API. You can modify the data models to match your data structure by adding, removing, or modifying the fields in the models.
4. Update the documentation: The docs folder and the README.md file contain the documentation for the API. You should update the documentation to reflect any changes that you have made to the code.

By making these changes to the repository code, you will have created a custom API that is tailored to your specific requirements.
